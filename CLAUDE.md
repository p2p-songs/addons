# CLAUDE.md — addons

## Scope
The first-party reference addons, in build order (Plan §10, Phase 3):

1. `musicmeta` — MBID → metadata + cover art (MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive)
2. `catalog-charts` — MusicBrainz browse + ListenBrainz trending/similar
3. `stream-legal` — Jamendo/Internet Archive/FMA, direct URLs, zero config
4. `stream-ytmusic` — `ytId`-style, official YouTube embed
5. `lyrics-lrclib` — lyrics via lrclib.net
6. `stream-debrid` — **the highest-scrutiny addon in this repo.** One
   self-contained addon (discovery + aggregation + **file selection** + debrid
   resolution), modeled on Torrentio, not AIOStreams. Read Plan §2/§2a and §3
   in full before touching this addon's code. Note the music-specific step:
   requests are keyed by `mbid:recording:<uuid>` (the song) but music torrents
   are **whole albums** — so it must pick the *right track file* inside a
   multi-file album torrent (by disc+track position when the request's
   album-context `mbid:track:`/`mbid:release:` is present, else fuzzy
   title+duration). "Largest file" (Torrentio's movie heuristic) does NOT work
   for music. See Plan §2a.

Full architecture: [`p2p-songs/.github` — `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](https://github.com/p2p-songs/.github/blob/main/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).

## Before implementation
Read `../.github/docs/audits/README.md` and its first (latest) report before
starting work. The registry owns current sign-off and supersession; do not rely
only on issue notifications.

## Invariants this repo must hold (see `.github`'s `docs/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` §2-§6 — read that file in full before implementing or reviewing `stream-debrid`)
Summary (checklist has the complete, cross-referenced version):
- `stream-debrid`: one addon, no plugin interface for aggregating other
  addons; never persists resolved audio bytes on its own infra; every
  debrid API call uses that request's own `/configure` credentials, never
  a shared/pooled account.
- `stream-ytmusic`: official embed (`ytId`-style), not raw `yt-dlp`
  extraction, by default.
- `stream-legal`: fixed set of CC-licensed/open sources only, never an
  open proxy for arbitrary URLs.
- All addons: conform to the protocol/ID scheme from `addon-sdk`'s
  `defineStreamHandler` etc. — don't invent ad hoc response shapes.

## Status
Scaffolding only (this file + README). No addon code yet. Build in the
order listed above — `stream-legal` first (proves the pipeline end-to-end
with zero legal/config complexity), `stream-debrid` last (highest
complexity and scrutiny).

## Being audited?
If you're the adversarial reviewer, not the implementer: start at
[`p2p-songs/.github` — `docs/ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW_CONTRACT.md`](https://github.com/p2p-songs/.github/blob/main/docs/ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW_CONTRACT.md),
not this file.
